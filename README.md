# ðŸš€ Subscription Modal â€“ Vue 3 + SCSS

A clean, responsive subscription modal designed to make plan selection easier and more intuitive.

---

## ðŸ§  Why

While using **Reedsy Studio**, I found the plan presentation a bit confusing. It wasnâ€™t immediately clear what was included in each plan, and I felt that this could potentially hurt conversion.

This project is my attempt to reimagine the UX of a subscription modal â€” to reduce cognitive load, make value obvious, and encourage upgrade decisions.

## ðŸ§© Assumptions

- **Essentials** is the foundation and always selected by default â€” users shouldn't have to choose it.
- Users can pick **one additional plan** to upgrade with (`Craft`, `Outline`, or `Craft + Outline`).
- The more clearly we show value (especially visually), the higher the chances of conversion.
- **Dark mode is not a real selling point** â€” itâ€™s a nice-to-have, not a core value prop â€” so itâ€™s included in the free plan.
- These assumptions should be validated â€” the ideal next step would be to run **A/B tests** and measure what actually drives upgrades.

## ðŸŽ¯ UX Goals

- âœ… Communicate upgrade value visually and quickly
- âœ… Reduce friction: no need to choose a base plan
- âœ… Pair emojis + features for fast comprehension
- âœ… Highlight differences between plans at a glance
- âœ… Keep layout clean and mobile-first
- âœ… Avoid feature bloat in messaging

---

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

- **Accessibility Improvements**: Ensure the modal is fully accessible, including keyboard navigation and screen reader support.
- **Analytics Integration**: Add tracking to measure user interactions and conversion rates.
- **Localization**: Support multiple languages to reach a broader audience.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize assets and code for faster load times.
- **Dark Mode Support**: Add a toggle for users who prefer dark mode, even if it's not a core selling point.
- **User Feedback**: Collect feedback from real users to iterate and improve the design.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- **Vue 3** + TypeScript (Composition API)
- **SCSS** for modular styles
- **Vite** for fast development and build tooling
- **ESLint** + **Prettier** for code quality and formatting
- **Jest** for unit testing
- **Responsive** design
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD
